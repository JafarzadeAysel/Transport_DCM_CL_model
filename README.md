# Public Transport:  Data-Driven Insights on Commuter Choices ðŸšŽðŸš—ðŸšŒðŸš‰
Surveyed over 100 participants in Sumgait and Khirdalan and built a Conditional Logit Discrete Choice Model. 
## Objective: 

Understand the transport choices and behaviors of residents in Sumgait and Khirdalan to inform potential public transit improvements.

##  Methodology
1. Data Sourcing & Ownership

2. Designed and administered a custom survey.

3. Collected responses from 100+ participants.

4. Personally managed data collection, cleaning, and preparation from scratch.

## Ad-hoc Analysis

Explored relationships between demographics, transport availability, and commuter choices.

Identified patterns in preferred destinations, metro connectivity needs, and transfer avoidance behavior.

## Modeling

Built a Conditional Logit Model to analyze the factors influencing mode choice.

Tested variables such as cost, waiting time, walking time, crowdedness, age, and location.

## Results & Strategic Insights
Key Findings:
- Destination demand is concentrated on 28 May, Yasamal, NÉ™simi, and XÉ™tai for commuting purposes.

- XÄ±rdalan residents want more direct metro connections without transfers, especially to Yasamal.

- SumqayÄ±t residents seek connections beyond the main rail link, with requests for more comfortable and direct routes to central and peripheral districts.

- Signs that SumqayÄ±t residents may prefer taxis and older respondents slightly prefer the fast train less (not statistically significant due to sample size).
