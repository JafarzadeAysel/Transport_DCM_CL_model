# Public Transport:  Data-Driven Insights on Commuter Choices ðŸšŽðŸš—ðŸšŒðŸš‰
Surveyed over 100 participants in Sumgait and Khirdalan and built a Multinomial Logit Discrete Choice Model. 
## Objective: 

Understand the transport choices and behaviors of residents in Sumgait and Khirdalan to inform potential public transit improvements.

##  Methodology
1. Data Sourcing & Ownership

2. Designed and administered a custom survey.

3. Collected responses from 100+ participants.

4. Personally managed data collection, cleaning, and preparation from scratch.

## Ad-hoc Analysis

Explored relationships between demographics, transport availability, and commuter choices.

Identified patterns in preferred destinations, metro connectivity needs, and transfer avoidance behavior.

## Modeling

Built a Multinomial Logit Model to analyze the factors influencing mode choice.

Tested variables such as cost, waiting time, walking time, crowdedness, age, and location.

## Results & Strategic Insights
Key Findings:
- Destination demand is concentrated on 28 May, Yasamal, Nasimi, and Khatai for commuting purposes.

- Khirdalan residents want more direct metro connections without transfers, especially to Yasamal.

- Sumgait residents seek connections beyond the main rail link, with requests for more comfortable and direct routes to central and peripheral districts.

- The negative coefficient indicates that personal cars are less preferred than buses for work trips, likely due to traffic and parking challenges. While public transport options like buses with dedicated lanes and fast trains are faster. But the effect is not statistically significant and may be due to chance.
